Chitter Challenge
=================

Summary
-------

This repo lays out the basis for a twitter clone called chitter. Where users can write peeps to each other.
The implementation uses Sinatra to create the web app and a PostgreSQL database to store the user and site information.
Users can register, login and out and create Peeps.They can also comment on Peeps.

Instructions
------------

* Clone repository
* Install gems using bundle install
* Ensure you have a PostgreSQL server running
* Change the database credentials in the datamapper_setup.rb to match your local PostgreSQL
* Run the app with bundle exec rackup
* Navigate to localhost:9292 on a browser (The port may vary)
* Register yourself then start Peeping

Areas for future development
----------------------------

* Refactoring of the code
* Improve styling
* Add Comment count
* Implement better authentication
